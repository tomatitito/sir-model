# An implementation of the SIR-Model using probabilistic programming

This project implements the SIR-Model, widely used in epidemiology, in the probabilistic programming language Anglican.
## Installation

https://github.com/tomatitito/sir-model

## Usage

It should be possible to call like this: 

    $ java -jar sir-modell-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

Because of this, you have to run `(-main)` from within a repl.

## Results

A link to results of running the model without using emprical data can be seen ![here](https://github.com/tomatitito/sir-model/blob/master/plots/plot-nodat-04:09_10:18small.p).
