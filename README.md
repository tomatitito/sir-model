# An implementation of the SIR-Model using probabilistic programming

This project implements the SIR-Model, widely used in epidemiology, in the probabilistic programming language Anglican.
## Installation

https://github.com/tomatitito/sir-model

## Usage

It should be possible to call like this: 

    $ java -jar sir-modell-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

Because of this, you have to run `(-main)` from within a repl.

## Results

Running the model forward 10000 times without conditioning on data yields the following distribution over possible influenza seasons. The blue-shaded are represents to 95% highest density interval (HDI), 95% of the outcomes that are more likely than the remaining 5%. Note that, while the HDI first becomes wider and then narrower again towards the end of the season, the variance within the outcomes is very high.

Running the model 10000 times conditioning on data from the 2015/16 influenca season yields the following results. 
I have used 24 datapoints representing weekly new incfections. The data are provided by the *Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI)*.
